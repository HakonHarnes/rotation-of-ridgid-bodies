This project is a part of the subject TDAT3024 - Mathematics and Physics (optional subject). The project aims to demonstrate the Dzhanibekov effect on a rotating object by using simulations. See the report for further details. 

## Project structure 

The 'classes' folder contains the source code for the methods. 

The 'tasks' folder contains the solution to the tasks, by using the methods from the 'classes' folder. 

The code will generate two new folders when excecuted: 'figures' and animations'.
